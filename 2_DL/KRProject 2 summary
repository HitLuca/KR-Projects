CheesyVegetableTopping
	we can delete it because it can be achieved with the use of CheesyTopping and VegetableTopping

IceCream
	Removed hasTopping some FruitTopping from definition of IceCream
	Renamed PizzaTopping into Topping
	Changed domain of hasTopping from Pizza to Food
	Changed ranges of isToppingOf from Pizza to Food
	Added element FruityIceCream equivalent to IceCream and (hasTopping some FruitTopping)

Redundant Elements
	SpicyPizzaEquivalent is equivalent to SpicyPizza, so it has been removed
	VegetarianPizzaEquivalent2 is equivalent to VegetarianPizzaEquivalent1, so it has been removed
	Vegetarian pizza is not equivalent to VegetarianPizzaEquivalent1, as a pizza with a new kind of topping would be considered a VegetarianPizza but not a VegetarianPizzaEquivalent1. We fixed it by removing VegetarianPizzaEquivalent1 and making VegetarianPizza equivalent to Pizza and (hasTopping only VegetarianTopping)
	SlicedTomatoTopping and SundriedTomatoTopping are a subclass of (hasSpiciness some Mild), but it's inherited from TomatoTopping. We removed the subclass definition in order to remove the redundancy

Added Redundancies
	RedOnionTopping, added subclass of hasSpiciness some Medium, redundant with the declaration of the parent
	Added HotPizza, equivalent to Pizza and (hasTopping some SpicyTopping), making it equivalent to SpicyPizza
	Siciliana, added subclass of Food, obvious redundancy
